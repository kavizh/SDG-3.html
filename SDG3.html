       <h1>What is SDG 3</h1>
       <p>Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3 or Global Goal 3), regarding "Good Health and Well-being", is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015.

       <h1>What is the background of SDG 3</h1>
       <p>Ensuring that every child survives and thrives depends on a combination of high-impact interventions including quality antenatal, delivery and postnatal care for mothers and their new-borns, prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, immunisation to protect children from infectious diseases and access to adequate and nutritious food.

        The UNDP reports that "every 2 seconds, someone aged 30 to 70 years dies prematurely from noncommunicable diseases - cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or cancer."

       <h1>What is the main aim of SDG 3</h1>
       <p>SDG 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, that seeks equitable access of healthcare services to all men and women. It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns, infants and children under five (child mortality) and end epidemics.

        Good health is essential to sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda. It focuses on broader economic and social inequalities, urbanization, climate crisis, continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, not forgetting emerging challenges such as non-communicable diseases. Considering the global pandemic of COVID-19, there is a need to give significant attention towards the realization of good health and well being on a global scale.</p>

       <h1>What all is contributed by SDG 3</h1>
       <p>Make investments in health a priority in business operations. Facilitate and invest in affordable medicine and health care for low-income populations. Leverage corporate resources (e.g. R&D, distribution, cold chains) to support health care delivery by public and international organizations.<p>
